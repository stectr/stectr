### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Steven Truong** and I am a first year Computer Science Major at UCI! I am interested in software design and my hope is to build the skills to create user interfaces that *flow* and craft cohesive experiences. My hobbies are [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/22wuvflylmfcylehjha3xob6i?si=36041e4f87534979), gaming, and tennis.
